Baseball was- is and always will be to me the best game in the world.
Don't let the fear of striking out hold you back.
Never let the fear of striking out get in your way.
Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.

Don't let the fear of striking out hold you back.

The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world- but if they don't play together- the club won't be worth a dime.
I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier- but not for you- fifty thousand dollars- or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun.
