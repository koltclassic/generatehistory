So while an incredible amount of progress has been made- on this fifth anniversary- I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly: My administration is going to stand with you - and fight alongside you - until the job is done. Until New Orleans is all the way back- all the way.
We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades- the desire and the will- but not the money- can still get the best education possible.
But what we can do- as flawed as we are- is still see God in other people- and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do- that's what I pray to do every day.
I know my country has not perfected itself. At times- we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We've made our share of mistakes- and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.
In fact- the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code. This will be a tough job- but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this- and I am prepared to join them.
We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed- we're getting back to basics- and doing what America has always done best: We're making things again.
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century- we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient- more transparent- and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.
If you were successful- somebody along the line gave you some help... Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
I miss Saturday morning- rolling out of bed- not shaving- getting into my car with my girls- driving to the supermarket- squeezing the fruit- getting my car washed- taking walks.
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century- we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient- more transparent- and more creative.

Let me be absolutely clear. Israel is a strong friend of Israel's. It will be a strong friend of Israel's under a McCain administration. It will be a strong friend of Israel's under an Obama administration. So that policy is not going to change.
I don't care whether you're driving a hybrid or an SUV. If you're headed for a cliff- you have to change direction. That's what the American people called for in November- and that's what we intend to deliver.
Now we're in the midst of not just advocating for change- not just calling for change - we're doing the grinding- sometimes frustrating work of delivering change - inch by inch- day by day.
Of course- there is no question that Libya - and the world - will be better off with Gaddafi out of power. I- along with many other world leaders- have embraced that goal- and will actively pursue it through non-military means. But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.
We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades- the desire and the will- but not the money- can still get the best education possible.
Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like you're flying high at first- but it won't take long before you feel the impact.
You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete- no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever- it is the gateway to a middle-class life.
We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.
I know my country has not perfected itself. At times- we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We've made our share of mistakes- and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.
With patient and firm determination- I am going to press on for jobs. I'm going to press on for equality. I'm going to press on for the sake of our children. I'm going to press on for the sake of all those families who are struggling right now. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I am going to press on.
The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I- therefore- intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt.
In America- there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world.
The Bush Administration's failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel- as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab world.
So while I will never minimize the costs involved in military action- I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America.
My family- frankly- they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church- so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.
My parents shared not only an improbable love- they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name- Barack- or blessed- believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.
You know- my faith is one that admits some doubt.
What I think is fair to say is that- coming out of the Republican camp- there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps I'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith - something which I find deeply offensive- and that has been going on for a pretty long time.
My family- frankly- they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church- so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.
It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week- the minimum wage- family leave- health insurance- Social Security- Medicare- retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.
I can make a firm pledge- under my plan- no family making less than $250-000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax- not your payroll tax- not your capital gains taxes- not any of your taxes.
But let me perfectly clear- because I know you'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250-000 a year- you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.
I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries.
On every front there are clear answers out there that can make this country stronger- but we're going to break through the fear and the frustration people are feeling. Our job is to make sure that even as we make progress- that we are also giving people a sense of hope and vision for the future.
We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.
We- the People- recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me- a freedom without a commitment to others- a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism- is unworthy of our founding ideals- and those who died in their defense.
For more than four decades- the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant - Moammar Gaddafi. He has denied his people freedom- exploited their wealth- murdered opponents at home and abroad- and terrorized innocent people around the world - including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents.
To avoid being mistaken for a sellout- I chose my friends carefully. The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets.
The Bush Administration's failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel- as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab world.
On every front there are clear answers out there that can make this country stronger- but we're going to break through the fear and the frustration people are feeling. Our job is to make sure that even as we make progress- that we are also giving people a sense of hope and vision for the future.
The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.
We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed- we're getting back to basics- and doing what America has always done best: We're making things again.
As I've said- there were patriots who supported this war- and patriots who opposed it. And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women- and our hopes for Iraqis' future.
You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete- no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever- it is the gateway to a middle-class life.
Our combat mission is ending- but our commitment to Iraq's future is not.
And I will do everything that I can as long as I am President of the United States to remind the American people that we are one nation under God- and we may call that God different names but we remain one nation.
But what we can do- as flawed as we are- is still see God in other people- and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do- that's what I pray to do every day.
We worship an awesome God in the Blue States- and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States.
A good compromise- a good piece of legislation- is like a good sentence or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say- 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'
I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.
If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls- then I must not be very good at reading them.
What I worry about would be that you essentially have two chambers- the House and the Senate- but you have simply- majoritarian- absolute power on either side. And that's just not what the founders intended.
It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century- we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient- more transparent- and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.
If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is- is that when we succeed- we succeed because of our individual initiative- but also because we do things together.
One of the great strengths of the United States is... we have a very large Christian population - we do not consider ourselves a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation. We consider ourselves a nation of citizens who are bound by ideals and a set of values.
I cannot swallow whole the view of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator.
It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week- the minimum wage- family leave- health insurance- Social Security- Medicare- retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.
After a century of striving- after a year of debate- after a historic vote- health care reform is no longer an unmet promise. It is the law of the land.
And so our goal on health care is- if we can get- instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year- it's going up at the level of inflation- maybe just slightly above inflation- we've made huge progress. And by the way- that is the single most important thing we could do in terms of reducing our deficit. That's why we did it.
But if you - if what - the reports are true- what they're saying is- is that as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care- at the margins that's going to increase our costs- we knew that.
I want to reform the tax code so that it's simple- fair- and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250-000 - the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs- the biggest surplus in history- and a lot of millionaires to boot.
We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war- a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization. Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq- we have met our responsibility. Now- it's time to turn the page.
I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson- FDR- and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history. But- you know- but when it comes to the economy- we've got a lot more work to do. And we're gonna keep on at it.
So long as I'm Commander-in-Chief- we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform- we will serve you as well as you've served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job- or a roof over their head- or the care that they need when they come home.
For more than four decades- the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant - Moammar Gaddafi. He has denied his people freedom- exploited their wealth- murdered opponents at home and abroad- and terrorized innocent people around the world - including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents.
In the end- that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?
On every front there are clear answers out there that can make this country stronger- but we're going to break through the fear and the frustration people are feeling. Our job is to make sure that even as we make progress- that we are also giving people a sense of hope and vision for the future.
Where the stakes are the highest- in the war on terror- we cannot possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation. Effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing- planning and collaborative enforcement.
The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I- therefore- intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt.
We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That's not leadership. That's not going to happen.
Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.
My family- frankly- they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church- so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.
We- the People- recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me- a freedom without a commitment to others- a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism- is unworthy of our founding ideals- and those who died in their defense.
My parents shared not only an improbable love- they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name- Barack- or blessed- believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.
I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions- just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person- it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually- our constitutions expand liberties- they don't contract them.
I opposed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. It should be repealed and I will vote for its repeal on the Senate floor. I will also oppose any proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban gays and lesbians from marrying.
What I believe is that marriage is between a man and a woman- but what I also believe is that we have an obligation to make sure that gays and lesbians have the rights of citizenship that afford them visitations to hospitals- that allow them to be- to transfer property between partners- to make certain that they're not discriminated on the job.
I think there are a whole host of things that are civil rights- and then there are other things - such as traditional marriage - that- I think- express a community's concern and regard for a particular institution.
I don't think marriage is a civil right- but I think that being able to transfer property is a civil right.
We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.
We need somebody who's got the heart- the empathy- to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom- the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old - and that's the criterion by which I'll be selecting my judges.
We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades- the desire and the will- but not the money- can still get the best education possible.
We need earmark reform- and when I'm President- I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.
Money is not the only answer- but it makes a difference.
I mean- I do think at a certain point you've made enough money.
The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is- is that when we succeed- we succeed because of our individual initiative- but also because we do things together.
I know that campaigns can seem small- and even silly. Trivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. And the truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. If you're sick of hearing me approve this message- believe me - so am I.
You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete- no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever- it is the gateway to a middle-class life.
I miss Saturday morning- rolling out of bed- not shaving- getting into my car with my girls- driving to the supermarket- squeezing the fruit- getting my car washed- taking walks.
A good compromise- a good piece of legislation- is like a good sentence or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say- 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'
When we think of the major threats to our national security- the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation- rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores- one from nature- not humans - an avian flu pandemic.
We- the People- recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me- a freedom without a commitment to others- a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism- is unworthy of our founding ideals- and those who died in their defense.

In the end- that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?
There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing- even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.
Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we're hardwired not to always think clearly when we're scared. And the country's scared.
And we can see the positive impacts right here at Solyndra. Less than a year ago- we were standing on what was an empty lot.But through the Recovery Act- this company received a loan to expand its operations. This new factory is the result of those loans.
Here at this site- Solyndra expects to make enough solar panels each year to generate 500 megawatts of electricity. And over the lifetime of this expanded facility- that could be like replacing as many as eight coal-fired power plants.
Tonight- we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers- or the power of our military- or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise- summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago.
What I worry about would be that you essentially have two chambers- the House and the Senate- but you have simply- majoritarian- absolute power on either side. And that's just not what the founders intended.
As a nuclear power - as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon - the United States has a moral responsibility to act.
Of course- there is no question that Libya - and the world - will be better off with Gaddafi out of power. I- along with many other world leaders- have embraced that goal- and will actively pursue it through non-military means. But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.
It's not surprising- then- they get bitter- they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.
It was not a religion that attacked us that September day. It was al-Qaeda. We will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.
Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we're hardwired not to always think clearly when we're scared. And the country's scared.
In December- I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax hike on middle-class Americans. But we cannot afford $1 trillion worth of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society. We can't afford it. And I refuse to renew them again.
My parents shared not only an improbable love- they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name- Barack- or blessed- believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.

The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.
With patient and firm determination- I am going to press on for jobs. I'm going to press on for equality. I'm going to press on for the sake of our children. I'm going to press on for the sake of all those families who are struggling right now. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I am going to press on.
Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we're hardwired not to always think clearly when we're scared. And the country's scared.
We've protected thousands of people in Libya we have not seen a single U.S. casualty there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.
We need to internalize this idea of excellence. Not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent.
What I think is fair to say is that- coming out of the Republican camp- there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps I'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith - something which I find deeply offensive- and that has been going on for a pretty long time.
People of Berlin - people of the world - this is our moment. This is our time.
We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war- a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization. Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq- we have met our responsibility. Now- it's time to turn the page.
We all knew this. We all knew that it would take more time than any of us want to dig ourselves out of this hole created by this economic crisis.
If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
I know that campaigns can seem small- and even silly. Trivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. And the truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. If you're sick of hearing me approve this message- believe me - so am I.
Four years ago- I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have. We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan- and in 2014- our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline- al Qaeda is on the path to defeat- and Osama bin Laden is dead.
The United States is not- and never will be- at war with Islam.
I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.
Where the stakes are the highest- in the war on terror- we cannot possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation. Effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing- planning and collaborative enforcement.
As I've said- there were patriots who supported this war- and patriots who opposed it. And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women- and our hopes for Iraqis' future.
There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people- all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes- all of us defending the United States of America.
Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on terrorism have reduced the pace of military transformation and have revealed our lack of preparation for defensive and stability operations. This Administration has overextended our military.
We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war- a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization. Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq- we have met our responsibility. Now- it's time to turn the page.
But do I think that our actions in anyway violate the War Powers Resolution- the answer is no.
We're not going to baby sit a civil war.
We are not at war against Islam.
No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well- you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President- I never will.
As I've said- there were patriots who supported this war- and patriots who opposed it. And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women- and our hopes for Iraqis' future.
We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition- where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential.
It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week- the minimum wage- family leave- health insurance- Social Security- Medicare- retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.
It took a lot of blood- sweat and tears to get to where we are today- but we have just begun. Today we begin in earnest the work of making sure that the world we leave our children is just a little bit better than the one we inhabit today.
Take off your bedroom slippers. Put on your marching shoes-' he said- his voice rising as applause and cheers mounted. 'Shake it off. Stop complainin'. Stop grumblin'. Stop cryin'. We are going to press on. We have work to do.
John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded.
Now we're in the midst of not just advocating for change- not just calling for change - we're doing the grinding- sometimes frustrating work of delivering change - inch by inch- day by day.
I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson- FDR- and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history.
