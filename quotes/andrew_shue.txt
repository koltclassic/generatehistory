Fear is that thing that keeps you up there on that other plateau. Fear is that thing that just keeps you closed down- and quite frankly- alone.
I have amazing friends who have led inspirational lives.
When you start suppressing feelings at an early age- it hurts you down the road. Full expression of anger and pain is very important.
When you have a tough loss- go through it and agonize. I had one loss that I still want to change- but at the same time I realize it is an important part of who I am.
If you can get a teen leader in each sector of a student population- you can pull people in. Everybody wants to get involved- but most are too afraid. When they see a person they think is cool leading it- they're first to join.
Life is the most exciting opportunity we have. But we have one shot. You graduate from college once- and that's it. You're going out of that nest. And you have to find that courage that's deep- deep- deep in there. Every step of the way.

With my new venture- Club Mom- we want to empower moms to feel their value and also build their collective power to make their lives better and easier. We want to bring them together as a community to share experiences and information.

The biggest lesson from Africa was that life's joys come mostly from relationships and friendships- not from material things. I saw time and again how much fun Africans had with their families and friends and on the sports fields they laughed all the time.
Winning isn't everything- but playing and competing and striving and going through things can be a lot of fun and really important. As long as you're doing it in a way that's healthy- sports can be an incredible opportunity.
Unfortunately- there are so many people who live their whole life in a place that is safe and protected and simple and they don't really have that strength inside to fly.
I was on Oprah's show recently talking about the people who impacted me the most. One was a teacher and one was my soccer coach. I didn't even go into my family- who had the most influence.
I'd never been a teacher before- and here I was starting my first day with these eager students. There was a shortage of teachers- and they had been without a math teacher for six months. They were so excited to learn math.
The most important role models should and could be parents and teachers. But that said- once you're a teenager you've probably gotten as much of an example from your parents as you're going to.
