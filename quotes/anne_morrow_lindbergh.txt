I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught- all the world would be wise- since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning- understanding- patience- love- openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable.
Grief can't be shared. Everyone carries it alone. His own burden in his own way.

Good communication is just as stimulating as black coffee- and just as hard to sleep after.
Don't wish me happiness - I don't expect to be happy it's gotten beyond that- somehow. Wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor - I will need them all.
It takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeeded.
Men kick friendship around like a football- but it doesn't seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces.
America- which has the most glorious present still existing in the world today- hardly stops to enjoy it- in her insatiable appetite for the future.
The wave of the future is coming and there is no fighting it.
By and large- mothers and housewives are the only workers who do not have regular time off. They are the great vacationless class.
Don't wish me happiness - I don't expect to be happy it's gotten beyond that- somehow. Wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor - I will need them all.
For happiness one needs security- but joy can spring like a flower even from the cliffs of despair.
Don't wish me happiness - I don't expect to be happy it's gotten beyond that- somehow. Wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor - I will need them all.
The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere.
Men kick friendship around like a football- but it doesn't seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces.
Arranging a bowl of flowers in the morning can give a sense of quiet in a crowded day - like writing a poem or saying a prayer.
I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught- all the world would be wise- since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning- understanding- patience- love- openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable.
The only real security is not in owning or possessing- not in demanding or expecting- not in hoping- even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what it was- nor forward to what it might be- but living in the present and accepting it as it is now.

Grief can't be shared. Everyone carries it alone. His own burden in his own way.
Life is a gift- given in trust - like a child.
When the wedding march sounds the resolute approach- the clock no longer ticks- it tolls the hour. The figures in the aisle are no longer individuals- they symbolize the human race.
Men kick friendship around like a football- but it doesn't seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces.
