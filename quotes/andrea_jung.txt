Avon invented the concept of direct marketing and direct selling beauty. And that's still very valid to us. We'll have a firm that will be around for another 114 years as strongly as it was the first 114.
A representative is free delivery she's a personal beauty consultant. Some people want that high touch.
The game in beauty is changing so much- if your product isn't high tech or can't make a unique performance claim - plump your lips- reduce your lines- look glossy- and stay on for 24 hours - you can't go to market today. I'm not just talking about a $20 lipstick- but a $5 lipstick!
There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?
If you feel like it's difficult to change- you will probably have a harder time succeeding.

When a woman earns a dollar- the payback is higher. She'll invest in her children- in their education- health care- and basic needs. The impact of a woman's role in the economy benefits society at large.

President Obama's 100-day plan is pretty impressive. I think it's a Wow 100-plus days. The administration is not operating from fear- it is trying to drive change for the future- and that's a good thing.

I feel like I'm part of history being made. I leave Apple board meetings thinking- 'I've got to do a better job.'
You know- you go home and you try on a new mascara- and I guess a male CEO can't do that.
I became CEO at the beginning of the hit on old economy stocks. When something like that occurs in your first six months as a CEO of a more traditional branded firm- it makes for a fast learning curve.
