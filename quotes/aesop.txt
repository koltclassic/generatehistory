Example is the best precept.
A crust eaten in peace is better than a banquet partaken in anxiety.

The level of our success is limited only by our imagination and no act of kindness- however small- is ever wasted.

Never trust the advice of a man in difficulties.
Every truth has two sides it is as well to look at both- before we commit ourselves to either.
A liar will not be believed- even when he speaks the truth.
Don't let your special character and values- the secret that you know and no one else does- the truth - don't let that get swallowed up by the great chewing complacency.
Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.
