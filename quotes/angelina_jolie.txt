Sometimes I think my husband is so amazing that I don't know why he's with me. I don't know whether I'm good enough. But if I make him happy- then I'm everything I want to be.
I'm just glad I was able to return to some of that innocence and beauty I had as a child when I started my own family- and my children brought me back some of that spirit.
All women do have a different sense of sexuality- or sense of fun- or sense of like what's sexy or cool or tough.
I've told Billy if I ever caught him cheating- I wouldn't kill him because I love his children and they need a dad. But I would beat him up. I know where all of his sports injuries are.
And my dad- you're a great actor but you're a better father.
There's something about death that is comforting. The thought that you could die tomorrow frees you to appreciate your life now.
If I think more about death than some other people- it is probably because I love life more than they do.
First and foremost comes my family and my life with Brad. We have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that.

The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I can't have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I'd rather not be in a cage. I'd rather be dead. And it's real simple. And I think it's not that uncommon.
I'm odd looking. Sometimes I think I look like a funny muppet.
I am odd-looking. I sometimes think I look like a funny Muppet.
Oh- God- I struggle with low self-esteem all the time! I think everyone does. I have so much wrong with me- it's unbelievable!

I like someone who is a little crazy but coming from a good place. I think scars are sexy because it means you made a mistake that led to a mess.
I think all women go through periods where we hate this about ourselves- we don't like that. It's great to get to a place where you dismiss anything you're worried about. I find flaws attractive. I find scars attractive.
And my dad- you're a great actor but you're a better father.
Without pain- there would be no suffering- without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right- pain and suffering is the key to all windows- without it- there is no way of life.
I don't believe in guilt- I believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person- and don't judge people in your life. I think you should live completely free.

I love to put on lotion. Sometimes I'll watch TV and go into a lotion trance for an hour. I try to find brands that don't taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me.

Everyone got kind of crazy with me mentioning I was in love with a woman.
I'm getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because I just can't stop lifting it- and I love that you know.
They're right to think that about me- because I'm the person most likely to sleep with my female fans- I genuinely love other women. And I think they know that.
If I think more about death than some other people- it is probably because I love life more than they do.
I am deeply grateful to the citizens of Sarajevo and the Sarajevo Canton assembly for bestowing upon me this incredible honor of citizenship. I am so proud to now be a part of such an extraordinary part of the world and fellow citizen to the people I deeply love and admire.
I don't think the money people in Hollywood have ever thought I was normal- but I am dedicated to my work and that's what counts.
To be intimate with a married man- when my own father cheated on my mother- is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.
I didn't really want to live- so anything that was an investment in time made me angry... but also I just felt sad. When the hopelessness is hurting you- it's the fixtures and fittings that finish you off.

I like to hide behind the characters I play. Despite the public perception- I am a very private person who has a hard time with the fame thing.
When I get logical- and I don't trust my instincts - that's when I get in trouble.
I've realized that being happy is a choice. You never want to rub anybody the wrong way or not be fun to be around- but you have to be happy. When I get logical and I don't trust my instincts - Thats when I get in trouble.

I always play women I would date.

I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns- the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.
They're right to think that about me- because I'm the person most likely to sleep with my female fans- I genuinely love other women. And I think they know that.
I don't think the money people in Hollywood have ever thought I was normal- but I am dedicated to my work and that's what counts.
I'd like to believe that the people that have supported me in my work or identified with me in films- the people that feel they know me- they do and they don't have misconceptions - they understand. I believe that.
