Every man gotta right to decide his own destiny.
In this bright future you can't forget your past.
My future is righteousness.
I don't stand for the black man's side- I don' t stand for the white man's side. I stand for God's side.
The good times of today- are the sad thoughts of tomorrow.
One good thing about music- when it hits you- you feel no pain.
Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts- don't complicate your mind. Flee from hate- mischief and jealousy. Don't bury your thoughts- put your vision to reality. Wake Up and Live!
Open your eyes- look within. Are you satisfied with the life you're living?

One good thing about music- when it hits you- you feel no pain.
My music will go on forever. Maybe it's a fool say that- but when me know facts me can say facts. My music will go on forever.
My music fights against the system that teaches to live and die.
The good times of today- are the sad thoughts of tomorrow.
Every time I plant a seed- He say kill it before it grow- he say kill it before they grow.
Tell the children the truth.
