The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect- except that you can't eat it. We should make every effort to make sure this disease- often referred to as 'progress'- doesn't spread.
I don't think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it wouldn't surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something. I mean- why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number?
I hope all of you are going to fill out your census form when it comes in the mail next month. If you don't return the form the area you live in might get less government money and you wouldn't want that to happen- would you.
The Super Bowl isn't for kids- I had a great time though and it was worth every nickel of it because by doing this lame piece about the game I can put it on my expense account.

The closing of a door can bring blessed privacy and comfort - the opening- terror. Conversely- the closing of a door can be a sad and final thing - the opening a wonderfully joyous moment.
If you smile when no one else is around- you really mean it.
Most of us end up with no more than five or six people who remember us. Teachers have thousands of people who remember them for the rest of their lives.
Making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving America a new sense of purpose.
