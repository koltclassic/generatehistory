In general I was a good kid. It usually took a lot to make me mad. But once I reached the boiling point- I lost all rational control. Totally without thinking- when my anger was aroused- I grabbed the nearest brick- rock- or stick to bash someone. It was as if I had no conscious will in the matter.
We live in a country that used to have a can-do attitude- and now we have a 'what-can-you-do-for-me?' attitude- and what I try to do is find ways that we can develop common ground.
No matter how good you are at planning- the pressure never goes away. So I don't fight it. I feed off it. I turn pressure into motivation to do my best.
Corporations are not in business to be social-welfare organizations they are there to make money.
When I entered high school I was an A-student- but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys. I went from being an A-student to a B-student to a C-student- but I didn't care. I was getting the high fives and the low fives and the pats on the back. I was cool.
Through hard work- perseverance and a faith in God- you can live your dreams.
If you go and talk to most people- they mean well but they don't have much of a breadth on education- of knowledge of understanding what the real issues are and therefore they listen to pundits on television who tell them what they are supposed to think and they keep repeating that until pretty soon they say- 'Oh- well that must be true.'
Education is a fundamental principle of what made America a success. We can't afford to throw any young people away.
With everything that is complex- we learn. If you don't learn- then it's an utter and abject failure. If you do learn- and you're able to apply that to the next situation- then you take away a measure of success.

Evolution and creationism both require faith. It's just a matter of where you choose to place that faith.
Over the years my mother's steadfast faith in God has inspired me- particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.
The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they're going to do better. That's why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There's nobody I don't say that to.
There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness. But what- in fact- does is having a cause- having a passion. And that's really what gives life's true meaning.
Here's a nation- one of the founding pillars was freedom of speech and freedom of expression. And yet- we have imposed upon people restrictions on what they can say- on what they can think. And the media is the largest proponent of this- crucifying people who say things really quite innocently.
Resist this war on God- freedom of religion and freedom of speech.
We're not planning for the future. If we continue to spend ourselves into oblivion- we are going to destroy this nation.
I want the government to provide the military so we don't get invaded by somebody and destroyed. I want the government to provide the roads so I can get from point A to B. In terms of taking care of my day to day needs- I want to do that myself. I want my community to do that.
People spending more of their own money on routine health care would make the system more competitive and transparent and restore the confidence between the patients and the doctors without government rationing.
Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that- they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on- because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now.
This is a country for- of- and by the people not for- of- and by the government. If we turn it over to them we cannot complain about what they're doing because this is a natural course of men and we have to hold their feet to the fire.
Nobody is starving on the streets. We've always taken care of them. We take care of our own we always have. It is not the government's responsibility.

We should be concerned not only about the health of individual patients- but also the health of our entire society.

Illogical thinkers throw names and slurs around because they have no arguments with which to rebut their opponents. Rational people have to keep hammering their points home.
There's no question that as science- knowledge and technology advance- that we will attempt to do more significant things. And there's no question that we will always have to temper those things with ethics.
You don't have to be a brain surgeon to be a valuable person. You become valuable because of the knowledge that you have. And that doesn't mean you won't fail sometimes. The important thing is to keep trying.
If you go and talk to most people- they mean well but they don't have much of a breadth on education- of knowledge of understanding what the real issues are and therefore they listen to pundits on television who tell them what they are supposed to think and they keep repeating that until pretty soon they say- 'Oh- well that must be true.'
I think one of the keys to leadership is recognizing that everybody has gifts and talents. A good leader will learn how to harness those gifts toward the same goal.
My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman.
Marriage is a very sacred institution and should not be degraded by allowing every other type of relationship to be made equivalent to it.
I first wanted to be a psychiatrist. I decided against that in medical school when I discovered that psychiatrists didn't- in reality- do what they did on TV.
Over the years my mother's steadfast faith in God has inspired me- particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.
We are more than just flesh and bones. There's a certain spiritual nature and something of the mind that we can't measure. We can't find it. With all our sophisticated equipment- we cannot monitor or define it- and yet it's there.
I detest politics- to be honest with you. It's a cesspool. And I don't think I would fare well in that cesspool because I don't believe in political correctness and I certainly don't believe in dishonesty.
We need to understand that we are not each others' enemies in this country. And it is only the political class that derives its power by creating friction. It is only the media that derives its importance by creating friction... that uses every little thing to create this chasm between people. This is not who we are.
The most important thing for me is having a relationship with God. To know that the owner- the creator of the universe loves you- sent His Son to die for your sins that's very empowering. Knowing Him and knowing that He loves me gives me encouragement and confidence to move forward.
Marriage is a very sacred institution and should not be degraded by allowing every other type of relationship to be made equivalent to it.

There is so much potential out there in young people and they aren't getting the right information or being encouraged in the right ways. This is our duty as a society.
Don't let anyone turn you into a slave. You're a slave if you let the media tell you that sports and entertainment are more important than developing your brain.
With everything that is complex- we learn. If you don't learn- then it's an utter and abject failure. If you do learn- and you're able to apply that to the next situation- then you take away a measure of success.

I actually don't think that I'm that much smarter than anybody else. It's just that I frequently just seem to know what to do- and I think that's wisdom.
You know- many people have said that I'm on the edge and I'm maverick for some of the big operations that I've done. I'm not at all. I pray I ask God to give me wisdom- 'Should I do it?'- guidance in terms of how to do it- who to consult with. All those kind of things are incredibly important.
In my own personal life- God plays a great role in the risk- because I pray before I go into the operating room for every case- and I ask him to give me wisdom- to help me to know what to do - and not only for operating- but for everything.
You can't allow the forces of political correction to shut you up. I mean- why are people afraid to say- 'Merry Christmas?' Give me a break. If people don't like it- yeah- they can go do something else.
