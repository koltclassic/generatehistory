My philosophy is: It's none of my business what people say of me and think of me.
My father was grounded- a very meat-and-potatoes man. He was a baker.
We are dying from overthinking. We are slowly killing ourselves by thinking about everything. Think. Think. Think. You can never trust the human mind anyway. It's a death trap.
I'm one of the slowest drivers on the road. I mosey along. If you're doing anything too fast- including living life too fast- that creates sudden death. If I have to be somewhere on time- I make sure I leave early enough.
My life turned out to be beyond my greatest dreams.

Well- everyone likes movies when they're a little kid.

We all dream. We dream vividly- depending on our nature. Our existence is beyond our explanation- whether we believe in God or we have religion or we're atheist.
I'm married. My wife- Stella - a beautiful woman. She's brought a lot of peace to my life- a lot of wisdom.
