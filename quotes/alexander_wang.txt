I mean- I've always said I have an amazing team and network of friends and people that I work with that- you know- inspire me and enable me to do what I do.
When I decided to launch my first knitwear line- it was because I saw a void in the basics category. The editors were always looking for cool- fashion-forward tees and sweaters. So that's where I started.
The industry's changed so much that you can't just design something- put on a great show- and say- 'Okay- my job is done.'
I was in fashion school- my brother has a law background- and my sister-in-law had worked in production- but none of us had a proper fashion business education.
I think everyone shares a fear of failure - that you're only as good as your most recent collection. That's definitely a fear- but it's a fear that fuels me- that makes me want to work harder- that makes me take on more challenges.

My mom would take me to restaurants- and the first thing I'd ask for would be a pen and a napkin- and I'd sketch shoes and shoes and shoes.
My mom would put me in these preppy little suits and slick my hair to the side. I have these baby pictures of me where I'm this little preppy kid with a sweater tied around my neck.
I never really did sports growing up. Maybe that's why they intrigue me. The technology that goes into that clothing is steps ahead- so it's always been something I look towards.

I feel so thankful that I'm able to be a part of something that I love to wake up and run to work every day.
