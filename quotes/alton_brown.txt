The thing that helped me get into the film business was that I went to school in Athens- Georgia and managed to get on- um- working on music videos for a band called R.E.M. and that kind of opened up a lot of doors for me.
I like television. I still believe that television is the most powerful form of communication on Earth - I just hate what is being done with it.
A balanced diet may be the best medicine. I was eating too much good eats. But people consider that part of your job- you know? Eat. And I do!
I say grace. I'm a big believer in grace. I happen to believe in a God that made all the food and so I'm pretty grateful for that and I thank him for that. But I'm also thankful for the people that put the food on the table.
The worst food you'll ever eat will probably be prepared by a 'cook' who calls himself a 'chef.' Mark my words.
Everything in food is science. The only subjective part is when you eat it.
The kitchen's a laboratory- and everything that happens there has to do with science. It's biology- chemistry- physics. Yes- there's history. Yes- there's artistry. Yes- to all of that. But what happened there- what actually happens to the food is all science.
A lot of food shows need only to tempt. Some food shows only need to inspire- to empower. And there are a lot of shows that do that.
I kept thinking- 'Somebody has to make a food show that is actually educational and entertaining at the same time... a show that got down to the 'why things happen.' Plus- I hated my job - I didn't think it was very worthwhile.
You don't want flame to hit your food. Flame is bad. Flame does nasty things to food. It makes soot and it makes deposits of various chemicals that are not too good for us. The last thing you really want to see licking at your food while it's on a grill is an actual flame.
I spent a college semester in a small town in Italy - and that is where I truly tasted food for the first time.
You know most of the food that Americans hold so dear - things like hamburgers and hot dogs - were road food- but even before they were road food- they were peasant food.
I think a lot of food shows- especially when we started 'Good Eats' back in the late '90s- they were still really about food. 'Good Eats' isn't about food- it's about entertainment. If- however- we can virally infect you with knowledge or interest- then all the better.
I'm a filmmaker who decided to go to culinary school. All I picked up was the fact if I didn't understand what was going on with every single ingredient- I could be qualifying for- like- the lunch food job at my daughter's school.
I am a filmmaker. That is all I've ever been. You know- Martin Scorsese makes films about the mob. And I make movies about food.
Do not allow watching food to replace making food.

Culinary tradition is not always based on fact. Sometimes it's based on history- on habits that come out of a time when kitchens were fueled by charcoal.
I'm like a really goofy home ec teacher.
I know people that could serve me canned tuna and saltine crackers and have me feel more at home at their table than some people who can cook circles around me. The more you try to impress people- generally the less you do.
I love poking fun at myself. I have a rather mean sense of humor.

I'm going from doing all of the work to having to delegate the work - which is almost harder for me than doing the work myself. I'm a lousy delegator- but I'm learning.

Enough people have now mentioned Bill Nye the Science Guy to me that I now desperately avoid it all costs.
My college degree was in theater. But the real reason- if I have any success in that milieu- so to speak- is because I spent a lot of years directing- I spent a lot of years behind the camera.
I have nothing but sympathy for the people who are forced to work with me. I'm better now at picking out those that want to play that game with me- and those that don't.
