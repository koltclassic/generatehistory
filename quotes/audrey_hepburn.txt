I have to be alone very often. I'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment. That's how I refuel.
I don't want to be alone- I want to be left alone.

The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mode but the true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman grows with the passing years.
The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes- because that is the doorway to her heart- the place where love resides.
The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears- the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair.
I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing- kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.

I was asked to act when I couldn't act. I was asked to sing 'Funny Face' when I couldn't sing- and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn't dance - and do all kinds of things I wasn't prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it.

If my world were to cave in tomorrow- I would look back on all the pleasures- excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness- not my miscarriages or my father leaving home- but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough.

The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
